# CascadiaJS 2019

Hello, Cascadians! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for attending my talk and taking the time to explore this repository. Below are a few things you might find useful.

## The talk

You'll find the actual talk on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfridRBNfds.

## Slides

You'll find my slides in `slides/source`. To build and run them locally, just:

```
cd slides/source
npm install
npm start
```

And in `slides/dist`, you'll also find a Pulumi program that deploys them as a simple AWS S3 website ([which should be running here](http://slides-67a1781.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)).

## Examples

In the `examples` folder, you'll find two Pulumi programs:

### asciigram

The full source of the ASCIIgram app. See the README for instructions on how to install one of your own.

### digital-ocean

A Pulumi app showing how to stand up a DigitalOcean droplet and managed PostgreSQL cluster. See the README for additional context and details.

## Running the Examples

The easiest way to run these examples is to step through the Pulumi [Getting Started Guide](https://pulumi.com/docs/get-started) (in order to get Pulumi installed and configured for you), then click the **Deploy with Pulumi** buttons in each one's README and follow the instructions.
