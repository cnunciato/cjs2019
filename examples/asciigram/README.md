This is the app I demonstrated in the talk. It's an event-driven, serverless web application and API service backed by DynamoDB.

[![Deploy](https://get.pulumi.com/new/button.svg)](https://app.pulumi.com/new)

If you'd like to build one for yourself, the easiest way to get started is to ☝️ click that button and follow the instructions.

You'll need is an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and these two standard AWS environment variables (so `pulumi` can deploy into AWS on your behalf):

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$YOUR_KEY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$YOUR_SECRET
```

And then, just `pulumi up`.

Have fun! And be sure to check out the [Pulumi community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com/), too.
